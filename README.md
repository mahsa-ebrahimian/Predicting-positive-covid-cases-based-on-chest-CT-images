# Predicting positive covid cases based on chest CT images

Corona virus pandemic has negatively affected people all around the world. This virus spread so quickly that
quick and accurate detection of infected patients is a critical step in fight against it. Due to scarcity of test kits in hospitals,
an automatic diagnosis model can be a quick detection option to prevent virus spread among people. Chest radiology examination
is a key screening method for this purpose. Early studies have shown that one characteristic of infected patients is abnormalities 
in chest scan images. A convolutional neural network model is proposed in this study to detect COVID-19 cases. An open source 
Kaggle database consisting of chest scan images is used.
